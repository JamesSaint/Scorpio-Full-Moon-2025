      <h2>üúÅ Message</h2>
      <div class="quote">You are being asked to release a version of yourself that was shaped in survival, not in truth.</div>
      <p><strong>Death‚ÄìRebirth</strong> invites you into an underworld initiation. This is not a minor shift, but a foundational transformation. The self that has performed, people-pleased, or protected through numbness is ready to die. Your soul is clawing toward resurrection.</p>
      <p><strong>Two of Cups</strong> illuminates this journey within the mirror of sacred relationship. This isn't transactional love‚Äîthis is the edge of vulnerability, meeting someone (or yourself) beyond stories, beyond shame. It reflects the rising maturity of your sacred masculine in response to Jo‚Äôs fire: her evolving divine feminine.</p>
      <p><strong>Nine of Swords</strong> is the echo of past trauma‚Äîgrief from your mother, self-abandonment from childhood, and the echoing anxiety of being unseen. But this card is not prophecy. It is a ghost. And you now have the capacity to sit with these ghosts, to hold them, and to let them dissolve in the light of your awareness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>üúÇ Astrological & Energetic Layer</h2>
      <p>This reading aligns with the <strong>Scorpio Full Moon</strong>‚Äîa time of emotional intensity, sexual truth, and soul-level purging. James, your natal <strong>Chiron in Taurus (4th house)</strong> is being activated: core wounds around safety, home, and emotional security are surfacing to be seen, not solved.</p>
      <p>Jo‚Äôs <strong>Capricorn Moon conjunct her South Node</strong> is facing karmic purification. Her inner child learned to repress needs to survive. In synastry, your <strong>Moon‚ÄìVenus trine her Neptune</strong> offers healing through fantasy, erotic truth, and spiritual emotional connection‚Äîbut only when grounded in raw honesty.</p>
      <p>In your Human Design, as a <strong>5/1 Emotional Manifesting Generator</strong>, your sacral authority must lead. Don't make decisions in the anxiety. Feel into your body‚Äôs yes‚Äîespecially when naked, free, and disconnected from societal noise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>üúÉ Integration</h2>
      <div class="quote">Love becomes your resurrection‚Äîbut only if you allow this death to be complete.</div>
      <p>Let yourself grieve the version of you who tolerated misalignment. Let the pain of not being chosen become the fuel to choose yourself. Let your sexuality be sacred and unapologetic.</p>
      <p>And remember: Jo cannot hold your whole truth until she fully sees her own. But your embodiment may be the medicine that awakens her deeper.</p>
